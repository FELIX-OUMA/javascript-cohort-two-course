//What is a Symbol? - A symbol is a unique and immutable data type in JavaScript. Symbols are useful for creating unique identifiers for objects and properties. They are also used to represent private data and methods in classes.

//Symbols are created using the Symbol() function. The function can take an optional string argument, which is used as the symbol's description. For example:

const symbol1 = Symbol();
const symbol2 = Symbol("mySymbol");

console.log(symbol1);
console.log(symbol2);

//Symbols are unique and immutable. This means that two symbols created with the same string argument will always be the same symbol. Additionally, symbols cannot be changed once they are created

//Symbols are often used to create unique identifiers for objects and properties. For example, the following code uses a symbol to create a unique identifier for a private property:

const symbol = Symbol();

class MyClass {
  constructor() {
    this[symbol] = "private data";
  }
}

//Symbols can also be used to represent private data and methods in classes. For example, the following code uses a symbol to create a private method:

const symbol3 = Symbol();

class MyClass {
  constructor() {
    this[symbol] = function () {
      // private method
    };
  }
}

//Symbols are a powerful tool that can be used to create unique identifiers and represent private data and methods in classes.
